# AE502-HW2
This is the repository for the code used in solving problem 3 of the homework.
I used sv_from_coe, coe_from_sv, and rv_from_r0v0 to convert both ways between the state vector and orbital elements.
CalcEA was used to convert from the given mean anomaly to eccentric anomaly, where using that value I could calculate the true anomaly.
perturbed_eom solves the perturbed equations of motion, using the given initial data in the homework.
Plots of the orbital elements were produced and included in my writeup.
